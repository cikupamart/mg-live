# Mata Garuda - Network Attack Map

Indonesian Security Incident Response Team (ID-SIRTII) has been collaborating with EEPIS to develop an application to analyse internet threats over IDS engine called Mata Garuda. The application has been deployed in many ISPs to watch nationwide internet threat. It will be producing a huge number of events, or IDS alerts in the near future. In consequences of those threats, we have been doing an effort with a spatiotemporal feature of which a world-map attack visualization. That is to visualize a bunch of event on a world map in the certain period of time to conduct an easier way of analysing event data.

The aim of the project is to provide real-time attack visualization, the application must show the user the attack information that will be related to a map. With those all obtained information, such a coordinate locations from the event are visualized on the attack map. There are five user menus in a real-time mode, the first menu is todayâ€™s statistics that inform statistical data within a current day. A second menu is a real-time event which informing the user a real-time of occurring events. The third menu is world map visualizing attacks. The fourth menu is a button to switch either a real-time mode or a historical mode. Then lastly, two buttons that enable to zoom in or zoom out to a specific location on a world map.
