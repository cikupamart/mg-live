Indonesian Security Incident Response Team (ID-SIRTII) has been collaborating with EEPIS to develop an application to analyse internet threats over IDS engine called Mata Garuda. The application has been deployed in many ISPs to watch nationwide internet threat. It will be producing a huge number of events, or IDS alerts in the near future. In consequences of those threats, we have been doing an effort with a spatiotemporal feature of which a world-map attack visualization. That is to visualize a bunch of event on a world map in the certain period of time to conduct an easier way of analysing event data.
